<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Izuehie Sophia Nmesomachukwu and I am a Pharmacist. I studied at the prestigious Enugu State University of Science and Technology.
  I have always been a goal-getter and this earned me a number of accomplished leadership roles i played while in school. I am informally known as BIG ZOE.
</p>

<p>I was born into a family of six, My parents, I and my three brothers.I am the first of four children, an only daughter as well as the first daughter which earned me my name ADA(ADA di ora mma) as the Igbo tradition befits. I hail from Agbilligba Nanka, Orumba North L.G.A in Anambra State, Nigeria. I am born and bred in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria. </p>

<p>I love watching movies, getting new items and unboxing them. I love dressing up, I'm always like i was born to wear dresses. I can be really reserved and outgoing at the same time. I don't really like people and i enjoy my company or at the very least the company of those i want in my space at that particular time. I am big on family, we were raised to be there for each other and I never forget that. I am a tough cry baby, very sensitive but never soft. PS: Do not mistake the both words. I love God, He has proven himself in my life a lot of times that I've lost count.  </p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
